                <h2>Part 1: Identifying the Problem (The Thin Wrapper)</h2>
                
                <p>I found myself scrolling through Instagram reels, hoping to take a break from coding, but I still found myself seeing tech related content that demeaned the field as a whole. All of these memes regarding dropping out of college to create your own AI SAAS (Software as a Service), which is really a Chatbot wrapper, and getting funded a ton of money to pursue this. Following this are the same stereotypes mentioned beforehand, with “tech bros” being exact replicas of each other. If pursuing tech is something that interests you then go ahead and go through the typical software engineering route making a stable $100k a year, but I can’t promise you that you won’t encounter the temptation of risking it all for a potential funding of $1 million for a low-effort company. </p>
                <p>Seeing this subset of Computer Science has led me to think: Is this really what the tech field is revolving around now? 
                </p>


                <p>What I'm referring to here is the ethical funding paradox prevalent in the field, which I saw in my scrolling sessions. Specifically, the company Cluely, a startup created by Roy Lee promoting AI-style interview cheating,                 <a href="https://www.ktvu.com/news/21-year-old-ivy-league-dropouts-raise-millions-launch-bay-area-ai-startup-cheat-everything">raised more than $5 million in seed funding to build their company.</a> </p>
                <p>But there seems to be a pattern with all of these founders. While looking at other products, such as Alexander Wang’s <a href="https://scale.com/">Scale AI,</a> as well as Caine Ardayfio and Anhhu Nguyen’s <a href="https://brilliant.xyz/products/halo">Halo X glasses</a>, I saw that they all came from an elite background. Lee had been <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/columbia-university-student-trolls-big-tech-ai-tool-job-applications-rcna198454">expelled from Columbia</a> , Wang had dropped out of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/alexandr-wang-educational-qualifications-how-an-mit-dropout-built-a-29-billion-ai-empire/articleshow/121862856.cmsl">MIT</a>, with both Nguyen and Ardayfio following by dropping out of <a href="https://www.ardayf.io/">Harvard</a>. </p>
                <p>The products have since then been successful, but this ambition represents a small majority of those who can be successful with this entrepreneurship mindset. The private schools they came from represent the best of the best of young adults in this country, and if they were able to be in that statistics, it's safe to say they do have a safety net to fall back on. 
                </p>
                <p>This illusion of the dropout entrepreneur is deeply misleading for the average person. <a href="https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/college-dropout-rate/">As of July 2021, 40.4 million Americans had some college experience but no degree.</a>
                  This statistic adds fuel to the fire (the success found after dropping out) by making this dilemma seem more common than it really is. Pairing this statistic with the knowledge that
                  <a href="https://theamericangenius.com/college-dropout-startup-myth/">4% of college dropouts become successful startup founders</a>, makes the probability success rate really small. Also it’s important to note that 62% of Unicorn founders held post-graduate degrees.
                
                </p>
                <p>This safety net allows many to push ethical boundaries, whether its outsourcing work for low pay or bringing down competitors, leading to this privilege. 
                </p>

                <h2>Part 2: Explaining the Consequences (The White-Collar Risk)</h2>
                <p>
                  It’s best addressed as “white-collar crime,” financially motivated, nonviolent or
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-collar_crime">non-directly violent crime committed by individuals</a>
                  , businesses and government professionals. I have taken this definition out of context, but I’m trying to imply that there is a privilege at the white collar level that people have, giving them the leeway to take these risks. 

                </p>
                <p>I believe everyone should take risks at different points in their lives, but the issue I see here is that many people are trying to copy successful startup founders who come from lives filled with pre-existing connections and backgrounds, who can tank a few failures here and there. </p>

                <p>A Notable example of this is the company Sitch, the AI-powered startup which matchmakers people based on AI’s suggestions. The company’s whole motto is to automate the matchmaking process by removing the “swiping” features which are prevalent in Tinder and Hinge, and replacing them with a matchmaker
                  <a href="https://download.joinsitch.com/how-sitch-works">who gets to know you and curates introductions based on compatibility, shared values, and your preferences.</a>
                </p>

                <p>This removes the whole physical attraction of finding a partner, and leaves it in the hands of a chatbot who essentially calls to ChatGPT or other LLM’s to pair up a user with another person which the AI deems “A Perfect Match!”
                </p>

                <p>They have recently raised <a href="https://www.globaldatinginsights.com/featured/ai-dating-app-sitch-raises-2m-launches-matchmaker-chatbot/">$2 million in pre-seed funding to fuel its expansion</a>
                  , which seems pretty overkill for a simple matching algorithm which was automated by AI. And to make matters worse their
                  <a href="https://www.globaldatinginsights.com/featured/ai-dating-app-sitch-raises-2m-launches-matchmaker-chatbot/">"Match" packages</a>
                  range from $90 - $160.

                <h2>Part 3: Presenting the Solution (Funding Integrity)</h2>
          
                <p>
                  The danger brought forth from funding companies, such as Cluely and Sitch, is the negation of integrity in our society. There is a priority for solutions that result in convenience rather than innovation. The privilege which these founders have, results in the “tech bro” name being rewritten into privileged, unethical bros, who find calling chatbots into their AI-Generated website, like the one you are reading on right now, and relying on pre-existing information to be summarized into an “innovative” solution.
