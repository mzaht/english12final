                  - The stereotypical founder displays significant hubris, assuming that success in technology grants them superior insight into complex, unrelated fields like politics, economics, and society.
                <br>- It is fundamentally unfair that individuals with inherited wealth can secure massive funding for low-effort, ethically questionable ventures ("quick buck") rather than focusing on long-term value.
              <br>
              - Current massive investments (e.g., in data centers and AI chip companies like NVIDIA) rely on the unproven "faith" that the AI boom is real. This continuous borrowing and leveraging of debt builds up fragility, increasing the economy's exposure to a significant market correction.

                  - Well it can't be this black and white. Everyone in a society would have unique opinions of whats not only a "low-effort idea/cheating" but what is also wealthy. I do think though that those that are wealthy seeing past their privaleges attempting to take even more power for themselves is a type of corruption.
                <br>
                - AI is a sneaky poison. Just as a poison can heal, AI can be a helpful tool; however, consuming it straight is leading to sickness. We see massive hype, claiming AI will take our jobs, yet it can hardly handle undergraduate work, let alone lead major change. It's concerning to see so much money and interest directed at something so functionally limited. At some point, the crowded bubble will pop.
